# G Can Build - Walkthrough Starter Template (Hono)

Welcome to the G Can Build Walkthrough starter template! This repository serves as the foundation for the YouTube walkthrough series where we explore building and deploying modern web applications. Link to the YT Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@GeorgeLe

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, production-ready tech stack:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with React
- **API Layer**: [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/) for lightweight, fast APIs
- **Database**: NeonDB (Serverless Postgres) with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) with GitHub and Google OAuth providers
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**:
  - Radix UI primitives
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - shadcn/ui component library

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_db_connection_string
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_oauth_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_oauth_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
